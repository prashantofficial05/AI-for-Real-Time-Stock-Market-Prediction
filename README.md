# AI-for-Real-Time-Stock-Market-Prediction

**Introduction:**  

  This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to predict stock prices in real-time. Using 
  historical stock data, the project aims to capture the patterns and trends in stock price movements, 
  enabling short-term price prediction. The project is built on an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural 
  network, a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture well-suited for time-series data, such as stock 
  prices, due to its ability to retain long-term dependencies.

  **Goal:**

  The primary goal of this project is to create an AI-driven model capable of predicting future stock 
  prices by learning from historical price data. This model aims to aid investors and analysts in making 
  informed decisions by providing short-term price forecasts based on past trends and price patterns.

**Description:**

  This end-to-end project includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction. 
  
  Key tasks include:

**Data Collection:** Gather historical stock price data using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance API).
**Data Preprocessing:** Normalize and structure the data for input into the LSTM model.
**Model Building:** Implement an LSTM model with recurrent units and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
**Training:** Train the model on historical data, allowing it to learn price trends.
**Prediction:** Use the trained model to make short-term price predictions based on recent data.

**Skills:**

**Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implementation of LSTM for time-series forecasting.
**Data Analysis:** Analysis and processing of time-series stock data.
**Deep Learning Libraries:** Utilization of TensorFlow/Keras for model development.
**Data Collection Tools:** Using finance to download real-time stock data.
Tools:
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras for model building, NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib 
  for visualizations.
  Data Source: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library in Python)
 
 **Metrics:**

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The primary metric to evaluate model accuracy.
**Loss Curve:** Track training and validation loss to monitor model performance over epochs.

**Summary:**

  The project demonstrates how an LSTM-based model can capture stock price trends and predict short-term 
  prices with reasonable accuracy. This predictive capability provides insights into future price 
  movements, helping investors identify buying and selling opportunities.

**Key Findings:**

  LSTM Model Performance: The LSTM model successfully captures stock price patterns over time.
  Trend Prediction: Short-term predictions align well with recent trends, showing potential for real-time 
   applications.
  Limitations: The model performs better in stable market conditions and may not account for sudden 
   external factors (e.g., news events).
 
 **Next Steps:**

  Model Refinement: Experiment with different model architectures, such as adding more LSTM layers or 
  adjusting dropout rates, to improve prediction accuracy.
  Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore optimizations in the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
  Feature Engineering: Incorporate additional features such as trading volume, moving averages, or 
  sentiment analysis of news to enhance model performance.
